#SideSouler

SideSouler is a project that I'll work on from time to time and that will more than likely never be "finished".

It is written in C# using MonoGame.

UPDATE:
This project is put on hold as of May 31st 2013. The reason? I have other projects that I feel are more important than this one. I will probably resume development of this as some point in the future, which includes porting it to another framework (like SFML, or something similar), but no promises.
